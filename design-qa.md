# Design QA

## Right-side current value and top-guide clearance

- Selected design: `screenshots/actual/tray-right-value-design.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-right-value-implementation.png`.
- Full comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-right-value-comparison.png`.
- Focused endpoint comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-right-value-endpoint-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 338×158 tray surface. The selected design uses `88` while the
  deterministic implementation uses `80`; comparison is limited to placement,
  spacing, marker scale, guide treatment, and typography.
- The current value remains visible as a blue number immediately right of the latest
  point, without a percent sign. The rail now adapts to the rounded value width
  (12px, 17px, or 22px for one, two, or three digits) so the label remains visible
  without always reserving the three-digit maximum.
- The compact marker now uses a 1px dot, no separate compact dot stroke, and a 2px halo.
- The upper horizontal guide is omitted while the upper Y-axis tick label remains.
  This keeps near-maximum trend segments clear of repeated dashes; the lower and
  middle guides preserve scale readability.
- The stored comparison predates the adaptive rail adjustment and is retained only
  as the earlier design baseline; it is not current runtime acceptance evidence.
- Native deployment is verified by matching SHA-256 hashes and a valid signed
  universal application bundle. Native visual capture remains blocked: the real
  338×158 `CGWindowID` capture returns only the macOS HUD material backing layer, and
  Accessibility activation exposes the tray menu instead of the custom popover.
  Therefore the installed client surface is not claimed as visually verified.

final result: blocked

## Unified tray and Settings refinement

- Current-run audit evidence: `screenshots/actual/unified-tray-before.png` and
  `screenshots/actual/unified-settings-before.png`.
- Accepted implementation: `screenshots/actual/unified-tray-final.png`,
  `screenshots/actual/unified-settings-final.png`, and
  `screenshots/actual/unified-settings-dark-final.png`.
- Side-by-side review: `screenshots/actual/unified-tray-comparison.png` and
  `screenshots/actual/unified-settings-comparison.png`.
- Viewports: tray 420×170; Settings 520×580; deterministic local browser data.
- P2 visual finding: the two surfaces used similar colors but inconsistent window,
  panel, and control radii. Named 8px/10px/8px geometry now keeps the native window,
  preference cards, selects, inputs, range pill, and destructive action aligned.
- P2 chart finding: the tray trend used a flat area fill and comparatively strong
  guides. A restrained accent gradient, round line joins, softer grid, smaller
  tooltip, and balanced 30px heading row now improve depth without reintroducing a
  card, outer padding, or duplicated content.
- P2 Settings finding: action icons and controls carried mixed sizes, and the save
  toast could cover the destructive action. Controls and icons now share a compact
  scale; the temporary save status occupies the unused native titlebar area.
- Accessibility finding: the two Settings selects had no accessible names and the
  save acknowledgement was not announced. Both selects are explicitly named and
  the temporary status uses a polite live region. Screenshot evidence cannot prove
  complete keyboard or assistive-technology compatibility; semantic snapshots and
  focused interaction checks cover the changed controls.
- Light and dark Settings states were rendered at the delivered size. Browser logs
  contained no warnings or errors, and the theme selector remained functional.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested consistency pass.

## Evidence

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-70e8982a-2269-46c3-b872-d92441ff2b49.png`.
- Normalized source: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-source.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-preview.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-comparison.png`.
- Native viewport contract: 420×420, light theme, deterministic local quota data.
- The fallback Chromium capture uses a 500×420 viewport because the local browser
  enforces a 500px minimum width; the 420px native width is verified by the Tauri
  configuration and the layout uses shrink-safe flex containers.
- Focused-region comparison was unnecessary because the normalized comparison
  keeps the header controls, all Chinese copy, axes, endpoint, and corners legible.

## Findings and fixes

- P2: the product mark and English product name occupied the most valuable top-left
  area. The brand block was removed completely.
- P2: collector state and pause/Quit actions were detached below the primary card.
  They now share one compact top status bar with the Settings control.
- P2: visible labels, relative time, reset duration, range change, chart tooltip,
  empty states, and accessible control names mixed English with Chinese. All popover
  content now uses Chinese and Chinese date/time formatting.
- P2: the frameless native surface had square corners. The tray webview is transparent,
  while root, popover, and content clipping all resolve to an 8px border radius.
- P2: the 500px-tall popover repeated trend context and used oversized whitespace.
  The native height is now 420px, the trend subtitle is removed, the status and quota
  rows are denser, and the chart is reduced from 230px to 205px without losing axes.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain after the implementation comparison.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: the macOS system stack and tabular quota figures are retained;
  Chinese hierarchy remains readable without clipping or unintended wrapping.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the top status row, quota summary, and trend heading are
  compressed into a 420×420 surface while preserving a readable 205px trend chart.
- Colors and tokens: the purple trend, neutral surface, and semantic collector state
  reuse the existing light/dark design tokens.
- Image quality and assets: no visible raster asset remains after the requested brand
  removal; utility controls continue to use the existing Phosphor icon library.
- Copy and content: all visible product copy and interactive labels are Chinese.

## Runtime evidence

- The rendered capture exposes `采集器已连接`, Chinese update time, all three action
  icons, Chinese quota/reset/change labels, `剩余额度趋势`, axes, and endpoint.
- The in-app browser bridge could not initialize in this run because of a runtime
  property conflict. Visual QA used isolated local Chromium against the same Vite
  surface; browser console inspection was therefore not repeated.

## Settings simplification

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-4b970c34-9d01-4f02-ada2-802a5a06d871.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-zh-compact-v3.png`.
- Comparison: `screenshots/actual/settings-zh-comparison.png`.
- Viewport: 960×680, light theme, deterministic local data.
- English headings, labels, options, actions, confirmations, loading text, and
  accessibility names are replaced with concise Chinese copy.
- Collector and startup controls are grouped under `常规`; thresholds and
  notifications are grouped under `提醒`; retention, disk usage, cleanup, export,
  and folder access are grouped under `数据`.
- Repeated explanatory paragraphs, the duplicate product name, the refresh action,
  and the current-page Settings action are removed from the Settings surface.
- The compact rows and action cards keep all controls, storage details, and the
  destructive action visible in a single 960×680 window without scrolling.

## Tray chart labels and spacing

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-e6d7f422-f818-4fec-afaa-21052d3f90e7.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-labels-v2.png`.
- Comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-labels-comparison.png`.
- Native viewport contract: 420×420. The fallback Chromium capture is 500×420
  because its local headless window enforces a 500px minimum width.
- The trend section now fills the remaining card height, moving the time axis close
  to the lower edge instead of leaving an unused footer-sized area.
- Horizontal padding and the Y-axis width are reduced while preserving complete
  percentage ticks. First, middle, and latest remaining values appear above the
  curve; limiting labels to three avoids collisions and visual noise.

## Tray time scale

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-7a18064c-9f6f-4d97-86d3-72b7752a94e4.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-time-scale-v2.png`.
- Comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-time-scale-comparison.png`.
- The X axis is numeric and continuous, and the area curve uses the original stored
  timestamps. Uneven collection intervals therefore occupy proportional horizontal
  distance instead of equal category slots.
- Axis labels use actual first, temporal-middle, and latest source records. No
  synthetic five-minute points or interpolated quota values are introduced.
- Spans near 24 hours include both date and time so identical clock times on adjacent
  days remain distinguishable; longer multi-day spans continue to use date labels.

## Settings without reminders

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-739c0a6d-6458-49b4-b2be-d0719c68e99b.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-no-reminders-14-days.png`.
- Comparison: `screenshots/actual/settings-no-reminders-comparison.png`.
- Viewport: 960×680, light theme, deterministic local data.
- The entire reminder group is removed, leaving only general behavior, data storage,
  and local-data removal on the Settings surface.
- New installs and the deterministic browser adapter show a 14-day retention default;
  the existing 1–365 day validation and user-configured persisted values remain intact.
- The removed native notification task and Tauri notification plugin ensure hidden
  reminder settings cannot continue producing desktop notifications in the background.

## Flat tray content

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-7a0c56dc-064e-4dea-86ad-0e645a08b4d6.png`.
- Implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-flat-layout-v1.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-flat-layout-comparison.png`.
- Viewport: 420×420, light theme, tray surface. The reference and implementation
  contain different live quota values, so comparison is limited to the annotated
  container treatment and preserved information hierarchy.
- Earlier P2 finding: the remaining summary and chart were enclosed by a white card
  with a visible border and 8px inner radius, contrary to the requested direct layout.
- Fix: `.tray-overview` now has no border or radius and uses a transparent background;
  its semantic `main` container and the summary-to-chart divider remain intact.
- Post-fix evidence: the implementation shows the summary and trend directly on the
  popover canvas with no enclosing card edge, corner, or elevated background.
- Focused-region comparison was unnecessary because the changed container occupies
  the complete 420×420 surface and its edges are clearly visible in the full view.
- Fonts and typography, token colors, icon assets, chart rendering, copy, controls,
  and hover/focus behavior are unchanged; no new image assets were required.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested flat-container change.

## Menu bar percentage and template icon

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-9fc06c34-18aa-4b3a-91ce-0deb25942c48.png`.
- Native implementation region: `screenshots/actual/menu-bar-percentage-region.png`.
- Focused implementation: `screenshots/actual/menu-bar-percentage-focused.png`.
- Focused comparison: `screenshots/actual/menu-bar-percentage-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: macOS menu bar, 720×40 points captured at 2× scale,
  light menu-bar appearance, latest stored quota showing 57% remaining.
- Earlier P2 finding: the tray item exposed only a purple rounded-square app icon,
  so the current remaining quota could not be read without opening the popover.
- Fix: the tray uses a transparent macOS template rendering of the existing quota
  curve and a native title containing the rounded remaining percentage.
- Post-fix evidence: the focused native capture shows the curve followed by `57%`,
  with no purple tile, colored surround, raster halo, or extra card background.
- The full native region proves alignment with neighboring macOS status items; the
  focused comparison is required because the icon and title are too small to judge
  accurately in the full 720-point strip.
- Typography is native macOS menu-bar text; spacing follows the system status-item
  layout; color adapts through template rendering; the reused curve remains sharp;
  and the percentage is concise without duplicated words.
- Interaction is unchanged: clicking the icon/title keeps toggling the existing
  popover, and the percentage refreshes from the latest local snapshot.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested menu-bar change.

## Context-menu actions and refined current value

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-1ea9f71f-b408-44c2-a175-6164a431759c.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-popover-browser-final.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-popover-comparison.png`.
- Native interaction evidence: `screenshots/actual/tray-context-menu-final.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×420, light tray surface, populated 24-hour trend. The
  source uses live 57% data while the browser adapter uses deterministic 68% data;
  comparison is limited to hierarchy, typography, spacing, and chart treatment.
- Earlier P2 findings: the inline collector/action header consumed vertical space;
  the chart heading repeated the trend title; the axis type was visually heavy; and
  the latest value was indistinguishable from the other representative labels.
- Fixes: the header and its stale frontend commands were removed; pause/resume,
  Settings, and Quit moved to the native Chinese context menu; reset time moved to
  the chart heading; axes use 9px muted type and lighter grid strokes; and the latest
  value uses the accent color plus a two-layer halo marker.
- First post-fix capture exposed a slash-formatted date and selectable heading text.
  The date was changed to explicit Chinese month/day copy and the native tray surface
  now prevents accidental text selection. The final comparison shows both fixes.
- Fonts and typography: the system stack is preserved; smaller axis labels remain
  legible, and the current value has the strongest chart-label emphasis.
- Spacing and layout: removing the header gives the summary and chart the full window;
  the divider, chart margins, 8px outer radius, and compact range pill remain aligned.
- Colors and tokens: existing canvas, accent, grid, fill, muted, and border tokens are
  reused in light and dark modes; no new arbitrary palette was introduced.
- Image and asset fidelity: no new raster or illustrative assets were needed; the
  existing Recharts area and Phosphor change icon remain sharp at native scale.
- Copy and content: all visible popover and native-menu copy is Chinese. Reset time is
  concrete, and the duplicate relative-reset line is removed from the summary.
- The full 420×420 comparison is also the focused component comparison: the changed
  heading, axis labels, and highlighted endpoint are readable at their delivered size,
  so a separate crop would not add evidence.
- Primary interactions tested: native menu opened; `暂停采集` changed to `继续采集`;
  collector was immediately resumed; Settings and Quit remained present. Browser
  console contained no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested tray refinement.

## Compact single-column Settings window

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-c07aa689-0665-4e3c-ad49-c6cd1f309a1b.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-compact-browser.png`.
- Native Tauri evidence: `screenshots/actual/settings-compact-native.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/settings-compact-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 520×580, light theme, populated local storage statistics.
  The source is the preceding 960×680 design and is normalized onto a 520×580
  comparison canvas; the viewport reduction is the requested product change, so
  comparison focuses on retained hierarchy, density, and control readability.
- Earlier P2 findings: the 960px window left excessive unused space; the branded
  top bar repeated the current page title; the top-right theme button separated a
  persistent preference from the other settings; and three horizontal data-action
  buttons became too small for a compact window.
- Fixes: the native window is 520×580; the Settings route omits the branded top bar;
  theme is a normal three-state row in the General group; and database cleanup,
  export, and folder access are full-width list items with consistent affordances.
- Post-fix visual evidence: the exact-size browser capture shows all settings without
  horizontal overflow or clipped copy and leaves only a small bottom inset. The
  real Tauri capture identifies the app-owned window and confirms the native macOS
  traffic lights remain clear of content; its earlier 520×620 height was tightened
  to 580 after that capture to remove the remaining empty footer space.
- Fonts and typography: the macOS system stack remains unchanged; group labels are
  quieter 12px metadata while row labels retain stronger readable weight.
- Spacing and layout: one column, 12px outer inset, 10px group rhythm, 42px rows,
  11px panel radii, and a clear 36px native-titlebar inset produce a compact rhythm.
- Colors and tokens: existing canvas, panel, border, accent, muted, and danger tokens
  are reused in light and dark themes with no new arbitrary palette.
- Image and asset fidelity: no new bitmap assets were required. Existing Phosphor
  icons remain sharp and consistent; the removed top-bar logo is intentionally absent.
- Copy and content: visible labels remain concise Chinese; default retention remains
  14 days for new installs, and disk totals plus reclaimable space remain visible.
- Focused-region comparison was not separate because the full 520px window keeps
  every changed row, icon, label, and control readable at delivered size.
- Primary interactions tested: theme changed from light to dark and back through the
  new row, with the root theme updating each time; all controls were present in the
  accessibility snapshot; browser console contained no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the compact Settings redesign.

## Reset-safe cumulative consumption

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-f8970cc7-f755-420d-bc01-fbac9810a1b9.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-cumulative-consumption-browser.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-cumulative-consumption-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×420, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour trend.
  The source and implementation use different quota snapshots, so comparison is
  limited to information hierarchy, range metadata, spacing, and chart treatment.
- Earlier P2 finding: the upper summary repeated a range-change metric while the
  range pill exposed only `24小时`, leaving no reset-safe measure of consumption.
- Fix: the repeated upper metric is removed. The chart pill now reads
  `24小时 · 已消耗 6%`, keeping the period and its cumulative consumption together.
- Calculation evidence: core tests sum only positive adjacent used-percentage changes,
  ignore the decrease caused by a reset to 100% remaining, and prove that later
  consumption continues accumulating beyond 100% instead of resetting or capping.
- Post-fix visual evidence: the comparison shows a quieter summary, an aligned compact
  pill, and unchanged chart emphasis. Browser accessibility output contains the new
  Chinese label and no `区间变化` text.
- Native Tauri runtime and the same frontend source were verified locally. Native
  tray-window capture was unavailable because the macOS Accessibility click did not
  expose an app window, so the exact 420×420 browser render is the visual proof.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested cumulative metric.

## Compact fixed-24-hour tray

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-cumulative-consumption-browser.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-24h-final.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-24h-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×360, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour trend.
- Requested simplifications: the quota-window label above the current percentage is
  removed, Y-axis tick labels are hidden, and every X-axis tick uses time-only copy.
- The backend history query and cumulative-consumption calculation now share the same
  fixed 24-hour window, preventing a seven-day statistic from being presented as 24 hours.
- First visual pass exposed a clipped first data label after reclaiming the Y-axis width.
  The plot keeps a 22px safety inset without restoring visible Y-axis content; the final
  capture shows all three value labels and all three time ticks fully visible.
- The popover height is reduced from 420px to 360px. The summary, divider, reset time,
  range pill, chart endpoint, and 8px outer radius remain aligned and readable.
- Browser accessibility output contains no quota-window label or Y-axis ticks, lists
  only three clock-time X-axis values, and reports no console warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the compact fixed-24-hour tray.

## Chart-only 128px tray

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-compact-24h-final.jpg`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-chart-only-128.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-chart-only-128-comparison.jpg`.
- Viewport and state: 420×184, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour trend
  with a fixed 128px chart.
- The standalone 68% summary and its divider are removed. Reset time and cumulative
  24-hour consumption now form the only header above the trend.
- The Y-axis remains visually hidden, while its three grid positions use the observed
  range directly: the upper guide intersects the 74% maximum and the lower guide
  intersects the 68.1% minimum. Equal-value histories retain a safe two-point domain.
- Plot margins move outward from 22/20px to 12/14px. The final capture keeps the first
  and current value labels, endpoint halo, and time labels within the viewport.
- Browser accessibility output contains no standalone current percentage or divider;
  the tooltip contract remains available and no console warnings or errors were found.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the chart-only 128px tray.

## Five-percent chart breathing room

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-chart-only-128.jpg`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-padding-5-final.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-padding-5-comparison.jpg`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour trend
  with a fixed 128px chart.
- The chart domain now extends by 5% of the observed value span above the maximum
  and below the minimum. Flat histories retain a safe one-point fallback margin.
- Outer tray padding is reduced from 10px to 6px, chart-section padding from
  `8px 6px 3px` to `4px 2px 1px`, and heading inline padding from 3px to 1px.
- The compacted 170px window keeps the reset time, consumption pill, first/current
  labels, endpoint halo, and time ticks readable without clipping.
- Browser accessibility output and console inspection report no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the requested spacing adjustment.

## Tray time-label clipping correction

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-padding-5-final.jpg`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-time-label-visible.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-time-label-visible-comparison.jpg`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, fixed 128px chart.
- The tray surface now owns the intended 6px outer inset. The previous spacing edit
  had changed an unrelated alert summary while leaving the tray at 10px; that alert
  spacing is restored and the tray inset is corrected at its actual layout owner.
- The 170px document has no vertical overflow. Browser geometry places the X-axis
  labels at 147.44–164.44px, leaving 5.56px before the viewport edge.
- Reset time, cumulative consumption, percentage labels, endpoint halo, and both
  visible time ticks remain readable; browser console inspection reports no warnings
  or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the clipping correction.

## Fixed left-center-right time ticks

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-time-label-visible.jpg`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-three-time-ticks.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-three-time-ticks-comparison.jpg`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, fixed 128px chart.
- Automatic tick omission is disabled for the three requested timestamps. A custom
  tick renderer left-aligns the first time, centers the temporal midpoint, and
  right-aligns the latest time so all three labels stay inside the plot bounds.
- Browser geometry confirms all three time labels at 147.44–164.44px vertically;
  the left label starts at 20px and the right label ends at 398px.
- Hovering the chart still exposes the Chinese remaining-quota tooltip, and browser
  console inspection reports no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the three-tick layout.

## Grid-owned tray spacing and integer current quota

- Previous implementation baseline: `screenshots/actual/tray-three-time-ticks.jpg`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-grid-current-quota.jpg`.
- Full-view comparison: `screenshots/actual/tray-grid-current-quota-comparison.jpg`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour trend.
- Read-only SQLite evidence shows the latest real `codex` weekly row at 47% used,
  which corresponds to 53% remaining. The prior 68.1% image was browser demo data,
  not a production-data failure; demo history and its snapshot are now aligned.
- The tray and chart containers have zero outer padding. CSS Grid owns the
  `28px 136px 6px` heading/chart/bottom tracks, while the chart margin owns
  the plot's 20px left, 28px right, 18px top, and 1px bottom safe insets.
- All quota percentages render as integers. The final 53% label spans 378.70–405.30px,
  and X-axis labels end at 166.94px, so neither touches the 420×170 viewport edge.
- Hovering the trend reports an integer Chinese remaining-quota tooltip; browser
  console inspection reports no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain for the grid and quota-value corrections.

final result: passed

## 90-day Token activity card and hover details — 2026-07-22

- Selected design reference:
  `/Users/daibin/.codex/generated_images/019f879d-1c7f-7bf2-9d0a-b8b5d8dac7d2/exec-e0f12801-5e78-4295-bcf5-d8eeea24c851.png`.
- Real Tauri rest state: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-90-days-final.png`.
- Real Tauri hover state: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-90-days-tooltip-final.png`.
- Same-state normalized comparison:
  `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-90-days-comparison.png`.
- The installed tray window is `CGWindowID 14876`, layer 5, at 338×352 points. The selected
  concept was intentionally adapted from a year view to the user's final 90-calendar-day scope,
  producing 90 real cells across 14 aligned calendar columns.
- The persistent card surface keeps only `今日 Token`, `会话`, and `调用`. Cached and non-cached
  input stay out of the resting layout and appear in the custom hover card together with the date,
  total Token, session count, and call count.
- The first real hover capture found that the 160px tooltip wrapped `非缓存` and ellipsized its
  value. The final tooltip is 190px wide with non-wrapping labels; `缓存 11.72亿` and
  `非缓存 4592万` are both fully visible while the bubble remains inside the Token card.
- The heatmap follows the selected glass, border, spacing, and four-level blue intensity language.
  Its 12px cells and 2px gaps remain legible at native tray size, and the selected cell receives a
  compact outline without shifting layout. There are no new raster assets.
- `just check`, `just test`, and `just build-gui` pass: 34 Rust core tests, 3 Tauri tests, and 32
  frontend tests. The
  installed binary SHA-256 matches the signed local universal release
  (`c5790553e321d8f4e13f70c5fa2e67d2edf58d2f4673c0ec57dc1164f99ce5da`), and the app plus its
  configured Volta Codex app-server child process are running.
- Complete DMG packaging remains blocked by the existing `bundle_dmg.sh` failure; the signed local
  `.app` build and `/Applications` deployment both succeeded.

final result: passed

## Token activity card and yearly heatmap — 2026-07-22

- Real Tauri capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-activity.png`, captured from the
  installed release app window `CGWindowID 14203` at 338×274 points (676×548 Retina pixels).
- The card sits directly below the quota trend and keeps the primary daily figures in one row:
  total input, cached input, non-cached input, session count, and call count. The captured live
  values match the SQLite aggregate after compact-number formatting: 502,519,593 input tokens,
  481,488,000 cached, 21,031,593 non-cached, 48 sessions, and 4,030 calls.
- The 53-week by 7-day heatmap presents the latest year from left to right with month markers and
  four square-root-scaled accent levels. All 371 cells fit inside the fixed tray width without
  clipping, horizontal scrolling, or a new chart dependency.
- The token card remains visible when quota app-server data is unavailable; only the independent
  quota trend surface changes to its waiting state. This behavior is covered by a focused render
  regression test.
- The installed application binary matches the locally built universal release binary, passes
  strict deep code-signature verification, and restarted its Volta Codex app-server child process.
  The signed `.app` was produced successfully; DMG packaging still failed in Tauri's final
  `bundle_dmg.sh` step and was not used for this local installation.

final result: passed

## Menu-bar alignment, chart density, and native glass correction

- Source feedback: `docs/design/reference/tray-glass-feedback-2026-07-16.png`.
- Final real Tauri capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-native-hud-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Full-view comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-feedback-final-comparison-2026-07-16.png`.
- Runtime evidence: macOS debug bundle PID 7610, tray CGWindowID 4315, layer 5,
  470×410 points at screen position X=1202, Y=30.
- First feedback P1: the CSS pointer and a second 10px native offset separated the
  tray from the menu bar. Both offsets were removed. The final window top is Y=30,
  aligned to the macOS menu-bar boundary.
- First feedback P1: CSS translucency alone produced an opaque gray-blue panel. The
  transparent Tauri window now owns a native active macOS HUD material at an 18px
  radius; CSS supplies only a 10% tint and translucent inner groups. Window-only
  CG captures flatten the live desktop backdrop to a neutral material sample, while
  the production window composites the material against the desktop.
- First feedback P2: the 454px frame gave the chart excessive vertical weight. The
  final frame is 410px, the chart header is 48px, and outer vertical padding is 14px.
- First feedback P2: a reset label near the live endpoint collided with the current
  value capsule. Reset markers in the final 12% of the selected time domain retain
  their dot but suppress their redundant text label; the current value remains clear.
- Fonts and typography: the macOS system stack, tabular numerals, weights, and sizes
  remain unchanged; the final capture has no collisions, clipping, or wrapping.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: both cards retain their established alignment and radii,
  while the reduced frame removes 44px of unnecessary chart height.
- Colors and tokens: the outer tint is subordinate to the native HUD material; inner
  panels, borders, selected state, text, and reset-credit accent remain translucent
  and legible.
- Image quality and assets: this surface contains no raster content or substituted
  assets; the Recharts line, axes, markers, and labels render at native 2× scale.
- Copy and content remain driven by live app-server and SQLite data.
- Focused-region comparison was unnecessary because all changed regions and labels
  are readable in the 1880×908 full-view comparison.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain.

final result: passed

## Glass reset-and-trend tray recreation

- Source visual truth: `docs/design/reference/tray-glass-reference-2026-07-16.png`.
- Normalized source crop: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-reference-normalized-2026-07-16.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-browser-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Same-input full-view comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-comparison-2026-07-16.png`.
- Viewport and state: 470×454 points, deterministic local quota history with one
  reset, four available reset credits, and the 24-hour range selected.
- First comparison P2: the outer pointer rendered as a detached diamond and the
  trend annotated its minimum rather than the reference's mid-range checkpoint.
  The pointer now merges into the outer glass border and the annotation follows the
  temporal midpoint while retaining first, reset, and current values.
- Second comparison P2: the implementation omitted the source's persistent current-
  value capsule. The final chart renders the current percentage in a bordered glass
  capsule beside the live endpoint.
- Fonts and typography: the macOS system stack, 12–14px controls and labels, restrained
  450–550 weights, and tabular numerals match the compact native hierarchy without
  clipping or wrapping.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the 470×454 frame, 15px pointer allowance, 17px content
  inset, 52px reset card, 12px group gap, and flexible chart card align with the
  normalized reference.
- Colors and visual tokens: translucent blue-gray glass, fine white separators,
  white quota geometry, and the cyan reset-credit accent reproduce the source. The
  browser capture uses a neutral canvas because desktop wallpaper is outside the app;
  the production WebView remains transparent so the same material composites over
  the user's desktop.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the target contains no in-panel raster assets.
  Recharts renders the line, markers, axes, and value capsule at native resolution;
  no placeholder imagery or custom image substitute is present.
- Copy and content: visible Chinese copy follows the source. Reset time, reset-credit
  availability, range history, and current percentage are all driven by real data.
- Primary interactions tested in the Codex in-app Browser: both range buttons resolve
  uniquely, 7 days becomes pressed after selection, 24 hours restores successfully,
  and no console errors are present.
- Focused-region comparison was unnecessary because every label, control, marker,
  border, and chart guide is readable in the 940×454 full-view comparison.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain. Rolling live timestamps and the neutral
  browser backdrop are expected product/runtime differences from the static mock.

final result: passed

## Fine-density tray polish

- Source feedback image: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-04b2896d-828c-445d-90f6-422ec46a3f83.png`.
- Real Tauri implementation: `docs/design/qa/tray-polish-pass-1.png`.
- Same-input full comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-polish-comparison-pass-1.png`.
- Focused control comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-polish-control-comparison.png`.
- Focused lower-section comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-polish-lower-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 340×565 points / 680×1130 pixels, dark theme, populated live
  quota data. The reference and implementation contain different live values and
  timestamps; comparison therefore targets the three annotated visual regions.
- Runtime evidence: macOS Tauri debug process PID 56639, tray CGWindowID 769,
  captured at native 2× scale with the current Vite/Tauri development source.
- Earlier P2 control finding: the one-hour selector had a comparatively heavy fill,
  large radius, and loose internal geometry. It is now a 43×19px control with a
  half-pixel edge, restrained shadow, tighter caret, and visible focus-within state.
- Earlier P1 heatmap finding: the legend occupied more vertical space than its fixed
  card allowed and could visually collide with the next card. The heatmap receives
  six additional pixels, uses responsive grid width, smaller legend swatches, and an
  11px verified bottom inset with zero scroll overflow.
- Earlier P2 event finding: four rows used large icons, broad timestamp columns, and
  high-contrast full-pixel separators. The rows now use a compact four-column grid,
  16px semantic icons, tabular right-aligned times, half-pixel separators, and a
  quieter title weight. The final row retains a 2px bottom inset with no clipping.
- Fonts and typography: SF system typography remains unchanged; headings use a more
  controlled 640 weight, event copy uses optical 8.5–9.5px weights, and all numeric
  columns retain tabular alignment without wrapping.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the fixed 565px window is preserved. Six pixels move
  from the events card to the heatmap, while the 8px card rhythm and footer remain
  unchanged; document and component overflow both measure zero.
- Colors and tokens: the existing macOS system-blue, neutral material, semantic red,
  and separator tokens are reused. The control edge and event dividers are derived
  from those tokens rather than introducing a parallel palette.
- Image and asset fidelity: no raster assets were added or substituted. Existing
  Phosphor icons and Recharts output remain sharp at native scale.
- Copy and content: visible Chinese labels, live quota values, true heatmap data, and
  persisted activity rows are unchanged.
- Primary interaction tested in the in-app Codex Browser: the unique `图表粒度`
  combobox changed from one hour to six hours and back; its measured geometry is
  43×19px. Browser console inspection returned no warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain in the annotated regions. Light theme was
  not part of the supplied state and is retained as a follow-up visual check.

final result: passed

## Header removal and real-data tray verification

- Real Tauri tray capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-real-24h-2026-07-15.png`.
- Real Settings capture: `docs/design/qa/settings-real-tray-range-2026-07-15.png`.
- Runtime evidence: macOS debug process PID 14928, tray CGWindowID 354, 340×565
  points captured at native 2× scale. The process was started by the repository's
  `just dev-gui` / `npm run tauri dev` path.
- The decorative traffic-light strip and branded toolbar are absent. The remaining
  summary begins at the top edge and the four data cards plus footer fill the reduced
  surface without clipping.
- The default 24-hour chart uses four time ticks, removing the overlapping labels from
  the supplied feedback capture. Value annotations, the y-axis, and the resolution
  control remain separated in the real window.
- Heatmap cells come from Rust's UTC-day aggregation of persisted snapshot deltas;
  resets and missing days do not create synthetic intensity. The captured database
  has two recent non-zero days, and only those cells are colored.
- Recent rows come from persisted `collector_events`; the capture shows the four latest
  quota-change rows and their recorded timestamps and deltas. Reset rows use the
  truthful state label instead of inventing a percentage value.
- The Settings real-window capture confirms the persisted `浮窗趋势范围` control and
  its default `最近 24 小时` selection.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.

final result: passed

## Fixed retention choices

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-8a5e9f3c-2867-4df5-9c81-77afbc525e7e.png`.
- Native implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-retention-fixed.png`.
- Focused implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-retention-fixed-focus.png`.
- Focused comparison: `screenshots/actual/settings-retention-fixed-comparison.png`.
- Real-window evidence: macOS Tauri Debug bundle, PID 20349, CGWindowID 823,
  title `Codex Quota Trends`, bounds 520×580 points, dark theme.
- P2: the numeric stepper allowed arbitrary values and exposed implementation
  limits in a compact preferences surface. It is replaced by the existing native-
  styled select control with 7, 14, 30, 90 days, and long-term choices.
- P1 behavior: long-term storage maps to zero internally and skips automatic expiry
  deletion. Unsupported legacy custom values normalize to long-term on load so an
  upgrade cannot shorten retention and delete history unexpectedly.
- The closed select, row spacing, typography, caret, and panel bounds match the
  existing settings controls. Expanding the WebView select through macOS Accessibility
  was not available, so the open menu itself is not part of the native capture; option
  membership and long-term behavior are covered by source validation and Rust tests.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain for the fixed retention control.

final result: passed

## Reset discontinuity and minimum value

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-2c85ad90-5d57-4ef0-a86b-a81686a957e3.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-reset-jump.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour history
  containing one weekly-quota reset.
- The minimum remaining value is always labeled independently of the temporal
  midpoint. The deterministic capture shows 51% as the minimum and 97% as current.
- The reset is represented by two samples at the same timestamp: the final
  pre-reset value and the reset value. Linear rendering therefore produces a
  vertical 51%→100% discontinuity rather than a gradual recovery curve.
- Unit coverage verifies the inserted reset boundary and confirms ordinary small
  quota corrections do not create a false reset.
- The 420×170 capture keeps the minimum marker, reset jump, current-value halo,
  cumulative consumption, and all three time labels visible without clipping.
- No actionable visual issue remains for the requested reset semantics.

## Visible reset value

- Source visual truth: `/var/folders/33/1n65110j6_15vm1fd1fydb440000gn/T/codex-clipboard-7325e170-49ca-43a4-8f99-a2a6c3fef8db.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-reset-label.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, deterministic history with a
  complete quota reset.
- The first post-reset point now has its own integer percentage label. The capture
  shows 100% above the vertical reset line while retaining the 51% minimum and 97%
  current labels.
- The hidden chart domain extends by the existing 5% range padding, capped at 105%,
  so a real 100% value has label clearance without changing the underlying value.
- All three time labels and the cumulative-consumption badge remain visible without
  clipping or overlap.
- No actionable visual issue remains for reset-value visibility.

## Continuous time ticks

- User clarification: X-axis time must be continuous rather than selected from
  nearby recorded samples.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/tray-continuous-time.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170, light tray surface, deterministic 24-hour history.
- The three visible ticks are calculated directly from the numeric time domain:
  start, exact midpoint, and end. The capture shows 12:16, 00:16, and 12:16 at
  equal horizontal intervals.
- Missing or irregular samples no longer shift the center label; sample timestamps
  still retain their real continuous positions for the curve and tooltip.
- The minimum, 100% reset, and current-value labels remain visible without overlap.
- No actionable visual issue remains for continuous time-axis labeling.

## Compact Settings updater control

- Browser-rendered implementation: `screenshots/actual/settings-updater-final.png`.
- Viewport and state: 520×580, light Settings surface, browser adapter reporting
  installed version 0.1.0 and the idle `检查更新` action.
- The updater occupies the otherwise unused upper-right native-titlebar area. Its
  26px action and 10px version metadata preserve the existing compact preferences
  hierarchy without adding another settings card or changing the window height.
- The update action remains clear of macOS traffic lights and the temporary save
  acknowledgement. Available, installing, ready, latest, and retry states reuse the
  same control geometry and existing accent, success, muted, and danger tokens.
- The version is loaded locally; network access starts only after the user activates
  the control. The combined version and action use a polite live region, and busy
  states disable repeat input.
- The 520×580 capture contains no horizontal or vertical clipping. All existing
  settings and the destructive local-data action remain visible without scrolling.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain for the updater entry point.

## Option 2 reset summary refinement

- Selected concept: `docs/design/reference/tray-popover-option-2.png`.
- Annotated feedback: `docs/design/reference/tray-popover-feedback.png`.
- Implementation: `docs/design/qa/tray-option-2-implementation.png`.
- Same-input comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-option-2-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 420×170 points / 840×340 pixels, dark tray surface,
  deterministic history containing one reset in the latest 24 hours.
- P1: the first option-2 implementation repeated remaining quota in the heading
  and at the current chart endpoint. The heading value was removed so the endpoint
  remains the single current-quota signal.
- P1: the vacated heading now shows the next reset time and the number of resets
  detected in the latest 24-hour window; cumulative consumption stays at right.
- P2: reset-count behavior is covered by a unit test that excludes resets older
  than the visible window.
- The implementation was rendered from the current frontend in a macOS WKWebView
  at the tray window's exact dimensions. The full-view comparison covers every
  modified region, so a separate focused crop would not add useful evidence.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain for this refinement.

## Full-height dark tray recreation

- Source visual truth: `docs/design/qa/tray-full-reference-original.png`.
- Normalized source crop: `docs/design/qa/tray-full-reference-crop.png`.
- Browser-rendered implementation: `docs/design/qa/tray-full-implementation.png`.
- Same-input full-view comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-full-comparison.png`.
- Viewport and state: 340×630 points, dark tray surface, deterministic local quota
  data, default seven-day range and one-hour resolution.
- The source and implementation use different language and quota values. Chinese is
  the product's established visible-copy contract, and the implementation displays
  live local values; comparison therefore treats copy language and metric values as
  intentional constraints while checking hierarchy, geometry, typography, and states.
- First comparison P2: the quota ring sat too far right, the trend plot's safe insets
  differed from the reference, the heatmap stretched too wide, and recent-event times
  were right-aligned instead of beginning in the reference column. The ring, plot
  margins, heatmap width, and event grid were corrected.
- Second comparison P2: the first trend annotation collided with the 100% axis label.
  The annotation now uses its own reference marker with horizontal clearance; the
  post-fix capture contains no overlapping chart text.
- Fonts and typography: the macOS system stack, compact weights, tabular metrics, and
  8–24px hierarchy reproduce the normalized source without clipping or wrapping.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the 25px window strip, 40px toolbar, 116px summary,
  149px chart, 140px heatmap, 115px event card, and 25px footer fill the native window
  exactly. Eleven-pixel outer corners and eight-pixel cards match the reference.
- Colors and visual tokens: the tray owns a deep navy canvas, slightly raised panels,
  quiet blue-gray separators, purple accent, and semantic red/green event states.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the canonical raster app mark is used directly;
  Phosphor supplies UI icons, and Recharts renders the ring and charts at native scale.
- Copy and content: every visible label and accessible name is Chinese; reset timing,
  history, heatmap, and recent-event rows are populated from the local data adapters.
- Focused-region comparison was unnecessary after normalization because every label,
  marker, grid cell, border, and control is readable in the 680×630 combined image.
- Primary interactions tested in the in-app Codex Browser: the range selector changed
  to 24 hours, resolution changed to six hours, and the overflow menu opened its
  Settings action. The final default-state capture has no browser warnings or errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain. The remaining differences are expected live
  data, Chinese localization, and the canonical product mark.

final result: passed

## CodexBar-inspired native material theme

- External visual reference: `steipete/CodexBar`, especially `MenuCardView`,
  `UsageProgressBar`, `UsageMenuCardLayout`, and the repository screenshots.
- Real Tauri tray capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-codexbar-theme-dark-final-2026-07-15.png`.
- Real Settings capture: `docs/design/qa/settings-codexbar-theme-dark-2026-07-15.png`.
- Runtime evidence: macOS debug process PID 14928, tray CGWindowID 354 at 340×565,
  and Settings CGWindowID 353 at 520×580, both captured at native 2× scale.
- The visual system now uses system blue plus semantic system red/green, translucent
  neutral group fills, system separators, and SF Pro typography instead of a dedicated
  deep-navy/purple dashboard palette.
- Layout rhythm follows an 8px outer group gap, 12px module insets, and 6px dense
  internal spacing. Settings uses 16px group separation with headings outside cards.
- The quota ring remains the product-specific signature; supporting cards are quieter
  so the reset metric and chart hierarchy carry the visual emphasis.
- First real-window review found the heatmap legend clipped by the fixed tray height.
  Height was reallocated from the summary and trend cards to the heatmap without
  changing the 565px window. The final capture shows the legend, event rows, and footer
  fully visible with no overlaps or truncation.
- Dark mode is verified in the real Tauri client. Light-mode tokens compile and follow
  the same ownership model but were not switched in the user's persisted settings.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain.

final result: passed

## Glass reset-and-trend tray final verification

- Final real Tauri capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-native-hud-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Final same-input comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-feedback-final-comparison-2026-07-16.png`.
- Verified at the production 470×410 tray viewport with live data and the 24-hour
  state selected.
- The menu-bar-aligned border, reset summary, reset-credit value, stepped trend,
  reference markers, current-value capsule, range control, and native HUD material
  are visible without clipping or overlap; no decorative pointer remains.
- The 24-hour and 7-day controls remain functional, and the final build contains no
  frontend, Rust, or packaging errors.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain.

final result: passed

## Large glass tray reference reproduction

- Source visual truth: `docs/design/reference/tray-glass-large-reference-2026-07-16.png`.
- Browser implementation: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-large-browser-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Browser same-input comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-large-browser-comparison-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Final real Tauri capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-large-native-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Native same-input comparison: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-large-native-comparison-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Verified at the production 652×492-point tray viewport. The source window crop and
  final macOS capture are both 1304×984 pixels at native 2× scale.
- Runtime evidence: final debug-bundle process PID 41518, tray CGWindowID 5615,
  title `Codex Quota Trends`, layer 5, and bounds 652×492 at x=1113, y=30.
- The outer radius, traffic-light strip, reset summary, icon boxes, two glass layers,
  24-hour badge, current quota hierarchy, three percentage guides, reset boundary,
  pre-reset annotation, stepped line, current halo, and time labels match the supplied
  reference without clipping, collision, or overflow.
- Browser QA uses deterministic 80% / 45% data to match the reference state. The native
  capture intentionally shows the current locally collected quota and reset history;
  no historical values are invented to force the live screenshot to match static copy.
- The app uses the native macOS HUD material plus translucent layered gradients,
  light borders, inset highlights, and restrained shadows. Phosphor supplies every
  visible icon; no placeholder, emoji, inline SVG, or CSS-drawn icon was introduced.
- The surface has no primary control in this design; the time-range badge is status
  content and the chart continues to expose its real-data tooltip semantics.
- `just check`, `just test`, and `just build-gui` pass. Rust tests: 30 passed. Frontend
  tests: 11 passed. The final debug macOS application bundle was rebuilt after the
  last typography and icon-color correction.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 visual findings remain. Remaining source/native differences
  are live quota values, live timestamps, and real history coverage.

final result: passed

## Two-thirds compact tray without traffic lights

- Browser capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-compact-browser-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- Real Tauri capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-compact-native-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- The tray window is 435×328 points, the rounded integer two-thirds size of the
  previous 652×492 surface. The 652×492 design canvas is rendered at a 2/3 scale so
  typography, cards, icons, radii, chart strokes, and spacing preserve their ratios.
- The decorative red, yellow, and green traffic-light elements and their CSS have
  been removed. The released top area is reassigned to the reset summary and chart.
- Browser DOM and exact-viewport capture show every reset label, quota value, axis
  label, time label, badge, and card edge without clipping or overflow.
- macOS runtime evidence: debug-bundle PID 39907, CGWindowID 5787, title
  `Codex Quota Trends`, layer 5, and bounds 435×328 at x=1152, y=30.
- `just check`, `just test`, and `just build-gui` pass. Rust tests: 30 passed.
  Frontend tests: 11 passed.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain.

final result: passed

## Medium tray with trend-only lower card

- Final browser capture: `docs/design/qa/tray-glass-medium-no-metric-browser-final-2026-07-16.png`.
- The native window preset is Medium 338×158 points with an 11px continuous radius.
- The lower card no longer renders `额度变化`, the large remaining percentage, or
  `当前剩余额度`. It contains only the 24-hour status badge and the trend chart.
- The chart expands from the left card edge and retains the 100%, 50%, and 0% guides,
  reset marker, pre-reset label, current halo, and three time-axis labels.
- The final 338×158 browser DOM and screenshot show no clipping or stale metric copy.
- The pre-removal native shell was verified at CGWindow bounds 338×158; the final
  change is DOM/CSS-only and the same Tauri window configuration is unchanged.
- `just check`, `just test`, and `just build-gui` pass. Rust tests: 30 passed.
  Frontend tests: 11 passed.
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 findings remain.

final result: passed

## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences remain.

- Typography: macOS system typography, compact weights, tabular percentage figures, and the
  two-line Chinese tooltip hierarchy match the reference. The implementation is rasterized at
  the product's actual compact viewport, so the normalized comparison is softer than the
  high-resolution generated reference.
- Spacing and layout: three adaptive percentage guides, the stepped line, current label, endpoint,
  and right-side safety gutter preserve the reference hierarchy without clipping. The current
  percentage uses the endpoint's outer edge as its right-alignment anchor, keeping the text and
  final dot on one right-side guide.
- Colors and tokens: history remains off-white; only the latest segment, current value, and current
  point use the existing tray accent token. The visible history path ends before the latest change;
  a separate white vertical connector and blue horizontal segment avoid overlapping strokes. The
  tooltip continues to use the established glass, border, and text tokens.
- Image quality and assets: the chart contains no raster imagery or custom image assets. Existing
  Phosphor summary icons are outside the changed chart surface and remain unchanged.
- Copy and content: hover copy uses the real point timestamp and `剩余额度：N%`. The demo values and
  reset boundary intentionally differ from the reference because the chart continues to render
  actual supplied history rather than mock the selected image's data.
- Interaction: middle-point and right-edge hover states were exercised. The tooltip stays inside
  the plot, points to the active dot, and no full-height hover cursor is introduced.
- Console: no errors or warnings were observed during the checked states.

## Comparison history

1. Pass 1 found a P2 tooltip-position mismatch: the custom tooltip overlapped the stepped line.
2. The tooltip was moved above the active point while retaining its pointer and horizontal
   alignment.
3. Pass 2 found a P2 right-edge alignment mismatch: both Recharts and the custom content reversed
   the tooltip, moving it too far left.
4. The end alignment now relies on Recharts for horizontal reversal while the custom style only
   controls horizontal anchoring. Middle and right-edge hover captures confirm the fix.
5. A real-data review exposed that the first implementation painted the blue endpoint segment over
   the complete white line. The history and endpoint are now independent paths, verified from the
   rendered SVG coordinates and `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-segment-fix.png`.
6. A native-data review exposed a second vertical offset on the tooltip: Recharts had already
   placed it above the active point while CSS moved it another 28px upward. Removing the duplicate
   offset reconnects the pointer to the point and keeps the bubble clear of the card's top edge.
7. Top-edge points make Recharts place the tooltip below the active point. The custom pointer now
   flips to the bubble's top edge for that state while lower points retain the downward pointer.

## Follow-up polish

- P3: a Retina-native capture would provide a sharper comparison than the 1× browser viewport,
  but it does not change the verified layout or interaction result.

final result: passed

## Reset countdown in total hours — 2026-07-21

- Browser capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-total-hours.png` at the native 338×158 viewport.
- The compact tray reset countdown now uses total hours and minutes, so multi-day values remain a
  two-unit scan such as `100小时 43分钟` instead of `4天 4小时 43分钟`.
- Durations below one hour continue to display only minutes; missing reset timing remains `待更新`.
- The rendered `51小时 42分钟` text occupies 62.26px and remains inside its 86.26px summary group;
  browser console inspection reports no warnings or errors.

## Latest chart point tooltip — 2026-07-21

- Browser capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-latest-tooltip-fixed.png` at the native
  338×158 viewport.
- The chart-level data now retains the latest point for tooltip indexing. The off-white history
  line uses a separate nullable field to end before the accent-colored final segment without
  truncating Recharts' shared data source.
- Hovering the final point selects the rightmost active dot and reports its current value
  (`剩余额度：80%` in the deterministic demo) instead of the preceding value.
- Browser console inspection reports no warnings or errors.

## Reset summary icon-only label — 2026-07-21

- Browser capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-reset-icon-only.png` at the native 338×158
  viewport.
- The left summary replaces the calendar with a counter-clockwise reset icon, removes the
  redundant visible `重置` copy, and keeps the icon beside the total-hours-and-minutes countdown.
- The summary card retains its `额度重置摘要` accessible name. The left and right groups keep an
  82.99px gap in the deterministic demo state, with no clipping or overlap.
- Browser console inspection reports no warnings or errors.

## Reset-credit icon-only label — 2026-07-21

- Browser capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-card-icon-only.png` at the native 338×158
  viewport.
- The right summary removes the redundant visible `重置卡` copy while retaining the card icon,
  available count, expiry date, and full accessible reset-card description.
- The left and right groups retain a 115.99px gap in the deterministic demo, with no clipping,
  overlap, console warnings, or console errors.

## Time-aggregated tray trend — 2026-07-21

- Rest-state capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-time-aggregation-rest.png`.
- Interval-hover capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-time-aggregation-interval-hover.png`.
- Reset-hover capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-time-aggregation-reset-hover.png`.
- Viewport and state: 338×158 browser surface with deterministic 24-hour history, one complete
  reset, and 30-minute display intervals.
- The X axis now uses snapshot timestamps over the selected real-time range instead of assigning
  equal width to each change record. The 24-hour view summarizes 30-minute intervals; the seven-day
  view uses two-hour intervals and is covered by focused unit tests rather than this capture.
- The percentage guides are evenly spaced rounded values. The reset demo renders 40%, 70%, and
  100%; the supplied 54%–89% case is covered as 50%, 70%, and 90%.
- Ordinary hover reports the interval, interval consumption, and actual remaining quota. The
  captured changing interval reports `本段消耗：2%` and `剩余额度：92%` without clipping.
- Reset hover preserves both observed values at one timestamp and reports `重置：45% → 100%`.
  A non-100% post-reset observation remains its actual value; no synthetic 100% snapshot is added.
- History remains off-white and the latest segment/current point retain the existing blue accent.
  No delta-based color scale or new visual token was introduced.
- Browser DOM inspection confirms the rounded guides and reset/interval copy. The console contains
  no warnings or errors. Real Tauri and seven-day visual captures were not performed.

final result: passed

## Settings Codex-path help icon — 2026-07-22

- Real Tauri capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-settings-path-tooltip.png`, captured from
  installed release app window `CGWindowID 13869` at 520×580 points (1264×1384 Retina pixels).
- The persistent Codex-path description is removed, restoring the first settings row to a compact
  single-line layout. A muted 14px information icon now sits directly after `Codex 路径` without
  changing the path-control width or the remaining row alignment.
- The icon exposes `留空时自动查找 Volta 和常用安装位置` through its accessible label and native
  hover title. Keyboard focus is retained with a visible focus ring.
- The installed application binary matches the locally built universal release binary and passes
  strict deep code-signature verification. The app restarted its configured Volta Codex app-server
  child process successfully.

final result: passed

## Token activity typography — 2026-07-22

- Real Tauri capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-fonts.png`, captured from installed
  release app window `CGWindowID 14259` at 338×286 points (676×572 Retina pixels).
- Token-card typography now uses 10px headings, 8px labels and month markers, 10px secondary
  values, and a 15px primary value. The previous sizes were 9px, 7px, 8px, and 13px respectively.
- The card gains 12 points of vertical space rather than compressing the heatmap. All five current
  metrics remain fully visible without ellipsis or overlap, and all 53 heatmap weeks and month
  markers remain inside the fixed 338-point width.
- The installed binary matches the locally built universal release and passes strict deep
  code-signature verification. The app and its Volta Codex app-server child process restarted
  successfully.

final result: passed

## Official Codex token activity — 2026-07-23

- Real Tauri capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-official-usage-july16.png`, captured from
  the installed release application at its native 338×352-point tray-popover size.
- The visible Token total and heatmap now use the same experimental Codex app-server request as
  the Codex client: `account/usage/read`. The generated local app-server schema identifies
  `dailyUsageBuckets[].startDate` and `dailyUsageBuckets[].tokens` as the daily series.
- Direct live evidence reports `1,082,620,516` tokens for 2026-07-16, rendered as `10.83亿`.
  This replaces the inflated `119.46亿` value previously produced by replaying inherited
  subagent history from local rollout logs.
- The official endpoint does not expose cache, non-cache, session, or call breakdowns. Those
  tooltip rows remain supplementary local-log metrics and are not expected to sum to the
  official account Token value.
- The local rollout parser now rejects inherited UUIDv7 and UUIDv4 turn histories inside
  subagent logs. Parser-version invalidation forces existing derived rows to be rebuilt when
  this semantic changes.
- `just check`, `just test`, `just build-gui`, and `git diff --check` pass. The installed binary
  matches the locally built universal release binary at SHA-256
  `13068b097a0bd5e30ee5754836d4795ec6a62396ea07fa9c9a4aeb97e1e4592f` and passes strict deep
  code-signature verification. The installed app and its configured Volta Codex app-server child
  process are running.
- The universal `.app` is complete and deployed. DMG creation still stops in the existing
  `bundle_dmg.sh` stage; this does not affect the installed application verification above.

final result: passed

## Token heatmap tooltip vertical collision handling — 2026-07-23

- Real Tauri capture: `/private/tmp/codex-quota-trends-token-tooltip-always-above.png`, from
  installed release app window `CGWindowID 15384` at 338×352 points. This capture is superseded
  by the collision report below.
- The always-above placement clips against the Token card when hovering its top rows. The heatmap
  now places Sunday and Monday tooltips below the selected cell and keeps the remaining rows above.
- Horizontal start/end clamping remains unchanged, so the card stays within the tray popover.
- `just check`, `just test`, and `just build-gui` pass. The debug `.app` was ad-hoc signed,
  installed, and restarted from `/Applications` as PID 38614; strict deep signature verification
  passes. CoreGraphics identifies the 338×352 tray layer as `CGWindowID 18374`.
- Real hover capture remains `Not verified`: the tray layer's window-specific screenshot contains
  only the macOS material backing, and Accessibility exposes the status item only through its
  native menu rather than the left-click event that opens the Tauri tray window. No browser preview
  was substituted for native evidence.

final result: implementation and installed runtime verified; hover visual evidence blocked
